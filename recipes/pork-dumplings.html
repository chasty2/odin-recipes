        <h1>Pork Dumplings</h1>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            I actually do have a story about this recipe, feel free to gloss over it &#128514;
            During the pandemic, my roomate and I would order so many potstickers that 
            we eventually learned how to make them. For much of the lockdown, Sundays
            became Dumpling Night. We would make dumplings in bulk with the intention
            of freezing them to eat throughout the week. They never lasted more than
            a couple of days &#128514;
        </p>
        <p>
            This recipe is from Paradise Yamamoto, a famous Japanese gyoza chef. It 
            is fairly time-consuming, but well worth the effort. Chef Yamamoto's 
            secret is to commit to the labor of love of mincing the pork by hand, 
            instead of buying it ground (also pork belly). Best served shared with
            loved ones &#128153;
