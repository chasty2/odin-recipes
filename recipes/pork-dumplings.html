        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            I actually do have a story about this recipe, feel free to gloss over it &#128514;
            During the pandemic, my roomate and I would order so many potstickers that 
            we eventually learned how to make them. For much of the lockdown, Sundays
            became Dumpling Night. We would make dumplings in bulk with the intention
            of freezing them to eat throughout the week. They never lasted more than
            a couple of days &#128514;
        </p>
        <p>
            This recipe is from Paradise Yamamoto, a famous Japanese gyoza chef. It 
            is fairly time-consuming, but well worth the effort. Chef Yamamoto's 
            secret is to commit to the labor of love of mincing the pork by hand, 
            instead of buying it ground (also pork belly). Best served shared with
            loved ones &#128153;

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p><em>Each filling makes ~25 dumplings</em></p>

        <h5>Meat Filling</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>6 Oz. pork belly, finely chopped</li>
            <li>6 Oz. pork loin, finely minced</li>
            <li>2 Tsp. grated ginger</li>
            <li>1 Tsp. sugar</li>
            <li>1 Tsp. salt</li>
            <li>1 Tsp. chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 Tsp. coarse black pepper</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp. sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp. Shaoxing rice wine or sake</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Meat + Vegetable Filling</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Cup Meat Filling (above)</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup scallions, chopped</li>
            <li>1/3 Cup garlic chives, chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup celery, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 Tsp. salt</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup green cabbage, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 fresh shiitake mushrooms, finely chopped (reconstituted if dried)</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Dumpling Wrappers</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Store-bought gyoza wrappers work nicely. Recipes for homemade dough
                can be found elsewhere.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Dipping Sauce</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Tbsp. soy sauce</li>
            <li>4 Tbsp. rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1 Tsp. sesame oil</li>
            <li>1/8 Tsp. hot chili oil (optional)</li>
            <li>1 Tsp. crushed garlic (optional)</li>
            <li>1 Tsp. grated ginger (optional)</li>
            <li>1 green onion (scallion)thinly sliced (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
           <li>For the fillings and sauce, just mix all ingredients thoroughly.</li>
           <li>
                Get a small dish of water to help with folding dumplings. Add 
                ~2 Tsp. filling to the center of a gyoza wrapper, and fold. 
                Wetting your fingers from the water dish will be helpful to seal
                the wrapper.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Note: </strong><em>There is no one true way to fold a 
                        dumpling</em>. There are many tutorials online to get the 
                        classic 'crescent' shape, or a myriad of other fun and zany
                        shapes. Or, you can just surround the filling with the 
                        wrapper. All of these options are equally delicious! My only
                        recommendation is to make sure the wrapper is sealed, so that
                        the dumplings don't explode when you eat them.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                To cook, place dumplings on an oiled thin pan. Sprinkle the dumplings 
                with ~2 Tsp. oil after ~3 min, or when the bottoms begin to brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                After the oil, add ~2 Tsp. of boiling water to the pan, and quickly
                cover. Only open the lid when you are confident they are done.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the lid, allow any remaining water to evaporate, and sprinkle 
                once more with 1 Tsp. of oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enjoy!! Add a sprinkle of salt to the dumplings for flavor, or serve
                with a dipping sauce (see above for an example. Again, <em>there is no one
                true way</em> to enjoy dumplings!!!).
            </li>
        </ol>
