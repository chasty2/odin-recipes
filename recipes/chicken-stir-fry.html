            Another delicous meal that is quick and easy. Cooks in one pot,
            and ready in less than an hour! Chicken thighs can be used in 
            place of chicken breasts, for those of you who are wrong about

            relatively small and evenly sized.

            <li>
                Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat.
                Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is 
                tender, and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, combine soy sauce, brown sugar, and cornstarch in
                a medium glass or ceramic bowl; stir until smooth. Stir in 
                ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes; add chicken and stir
                to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least
                15 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a wok or large skillet over
                medium-high heat. Add broccoli, onion, carrots, water 
                chestnuts, and bell pepper; cook and stir until just tender, 
                about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables into a dish; set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil in the same wok or 
                skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, reserving marinade,
                and cook until just browned, about 2 minutes per side; stir in
                vegetables and reserved marinade. Bring to a boil; cook and 
                stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center and vegetables
                are tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
            </li>
